# Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using the UCI Student Performance dataset. 
The goal is to understand how demographic, family, and lifestyle factors affect students' final grades.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Records: School students
- Target Variable: G3 (Final Grade)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Gender vs academic performance
- Impact of absences on grades
- Effect of alcohol consumption
- Parental education influence
- Correlation between G1, G2, and G3

## 📈 Key Insights
- Previous grades (G1 and G2) strongly predict final performance
- Higher alcohol consumption negatively affects grades
- Increased absences reduce academic performance
- Parental education positively impacts student outcomes

## ✅ Conclusion
Student performance is influenced by both academic history and lifestyle factors. 
Reducing absences and unhealthy habits can significantly improve outcomes.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Predict final grades using machine learning
- Classify students as pass/fail
- Build interactive dashboards
